# SSX Quickstart

SSX Quickstart is an extremely basic Client/Server demo to help developers get their hands on a fully functional and easy to understand demo.

In this quickstart we will guide you to build an application by using SSX authorization and storage modules, and integrate with [Rebase](https://github.com/spruceid/rebase) for credential issuance.

A code-along tutorial can be found in the subfolders README.md and on [...]().
